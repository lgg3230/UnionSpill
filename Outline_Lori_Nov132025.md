# Outside Options and Collective Bargaining Spillovers
Luis de Azevedo-Gomes and Guilherme Neri

#### Abstract:



### Motivation: 

- In labor markets with imperfect competition, the quality of outside options affects workers current jobs:
    - Workers can move to better options if they want.
    - Wage posting: labor supply becomes more elastic, leading to wage increases
    - Wage bargaining: workers can bargain for better compensation at their current jobs

- Increases in Union's bargaining power lead to improvements in both wages and amenitities at the affected firms (cite papers)

- *Research Question*: What happens to workers who see these affected firms as their outside options?

#### Contribution to the Literature:

- We measure effects stemming from a direct improvement in outside options

- This improvement in outside options comes from improvements in union bargaining power

- We show how improvements in union bargaining power spread through the labor market

- This spread does not require union presence to occur.

### Context:

#### Union Structure in Brazil

#### The Súmula 277's 2012 Reform

### Data:

- RAIS

- CBA's from Sistema Mediador (Lagos, 2025)

### Direct Effects from the Reform

#### Empirical Strategy

#### Results

### Spillover Effects

### Potential Mechanisms

#### Union Effects

- Unions could be mediating spillover effects:
    - Unions can cover more than one establishment in Brazil
    - Unions that are more exposed to treated units will have higher revenue
    - Unions more exposed to treated units do not need to spend too many resources bargaining for wages in treated firms
        - treatment is increase in that establishment's disagreement points
    - Thus, these unions can increase support for their non-treated firms
    - As such, the more exposed a union is to treatment, the larger should the spillover effect be on control firms.
